React Best Practices
====================

## SWBAT

- [ ] Write cleaner React code

## Objectives

- Opinions
  - [ ] Code Organization/file structure 
  - [ ] Presentational vs Container components

- Optimizations:
  - [ ] Functional vs Class Components
  - [ ] Fragments

- Best Practices:
  - [ ] Functional setState
  - [ ] "then" callback for setState
  - [ ] Callbacks (avoid useless wrapping)

- JS tricks/bugs often seen in React:
  - [ ] Arrow functions returning objects
  - [ ] Destructuring
  - [ ] Spread (w/ prepend and append)
  - [ ] Objects with the same key/value name
  - [ ] constructor vs. ES7 instance variables
  - [ ] map (as a way to update objects in an array of objects)
  - [ ] { [variable]: "as_key" }
