## Notes


### Authentication
Deals with passwords and verifying identity

Username is used to identify a user
Password is used to verify that you are actually this user

Proving that someone is who they say they are.

What is the point of Auth?
To get a user in state.


Control what the user experience is (what they see, what they can do)
What information to show (user details)
