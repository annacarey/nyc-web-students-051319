JSX & Props
=============================

## SWBATs
- [ ] Understand how `create-react-app` works and what it offers a developer
- [ ] Organize code into files and use the import-export syntax to pass ddata between components
- [ ] Use props to make components more dynamic and reusable
- [ ] Setup a new React app and play around with building UIs
- [ ] **BONUS** Use the `children` prop

### Import Export
- Way to share information across files


### Thinking about props

In thinking about props, repeat this mantra: props are to components as arguments are to functions!

Think back to mod 1:
Before ActiveRecord, you passed in arguments one by one and in a particular order: `User.new("Alex", 23, "therapist"`

With ActiveRecord, you passed a single hash and mapped your values onto the specific keys they corresponded to:
`User.new(name: "Alex", age: 23, occupation: "therapist"`

This is very much analogous to the change over from regular ol' JS functions to JSX components
